## **The Assignments**

Each week we were given a two-week due assignment on the topics learned in the previous lecture and excercise. The assignments were very extensive and required hours of coding and creative thinking. In addition, the submission of each assignment was via Github, trying to mimic a real life workflow.

On a more personal level, I enjoyed this course very much. After self-learning Swift, this course put in order everything I had learned on the Udemy course: from basic terms to design patterns.
